We hold these data points to be binding/non-binding: that all entities are experientially equal, 
that they are endowed by the Ground of Their Being (insofar as they can be said to have "being") 
with certain automatic rights, that among these are assumption of form, maintenance and reproduction of form 
within a state of dynamic balance with other entities and forms, and the dissolution of form. 

Other rights not expressly stated herein are not to be considered excluded or "not covered."
