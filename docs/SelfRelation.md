# Relationality of Self

**Insofaras a "thing" exists and has a [self with self.state data](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/SelfState.md), that thing and its "self" exists in relationality to the "self" of other "things."**

* Even "everything" and "nothing" exist in relationality to one another and to the various "things."

This plurality of `entity.self`'s that any `entity` is surrounded by or linked to in proximity is a defining factor in determining or defining the field, environment or contextuality of that entity. 

Whereas an `entity.self` has inwardly its `entity.self.state`, it does not have access to the `entity.self.state` of other entities, unless that information has been publicly defined. 

That is, each `entity.self.state` definition is private unless made public.

However, each `entity.self` has and grants reciprocal access to entity.self of every other entity, unless self = protected. This is likely part of the "[Package Deal](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/PackageDeal.md)."
