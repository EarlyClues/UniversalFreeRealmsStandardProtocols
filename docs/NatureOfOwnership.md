# On the Nature of Ownership

Whereas, an entity as a "thing itself" can be said to ["have" itself](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/SelfState.md)... (*while still retaining the [option to "not have"](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/SelfOwnership.md) if desired*)

And whereas, [access to/discoverability of the `Thingness Functions`](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/DiscoverabilityMutualityArbitration.md) of any `entity` or `thing` may not be blocked (*except where exercise of those functions inhibits the equal expression of those functions in other entities*)... 

We come to the question of "ownership" by entities of "things" that are not "themselves."

## Conventional (Non-UFR) Understanding

Conventionally (outside of the Universal Free Realms), one is apt to see definitions of the [rights of ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property) like the below:

> Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as perhaps to abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it..., or at the very least exclusively keep it.

However, under UFR principles, no entity necessarily has the "right" to - for example - consume, alter, redefine or destroy another entity where such action would violate the "thingness of the thing" and would restrict said entity from expressing its `Thingness Functions`.

## Co-Ownership & Reciprocity

What then, if anything, under the UFR principles would "ownership" consist of?

Perhaps "ownership" could be re-evaluated as just another type of relationship between entities. One might put forward a notion of "mutual belonging" to describe this revised concept of ownership. 

**That is, two entities which can be said to be engaged in an "ownership" relationship do so willingly, contractually, and according to a principle of reciprocity or "duplexing".**

*For example:*

According to established UFR understanding, it can be stated:

**Entity "has" self.**

With the above duplex-approach applied, we can also say:

**Self "has" entity.**

Or

**I "have" cat.**

As

**Cat "has" me.**

That is, "entity" and "self" are co-owners of their mutual relationship of "ownership." Any modifications or re-assignments of that relationship would require the **voluntary contractual assent** of both parties.
