# Entity Networks

In the [Relationality of Self](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/SelfRelation.md), it is written:

>This plurality of `entity.self`'s that any entity is surrounded by or linked to in proximity is a defining factor in determining or defining the field, environment or contextuality of that entity. 

The purpose of present document is to expound on this concept of multiple "entities" in relation to one another. For present purposes, we will use the word "network" to describe this inter-relationship web between entities in a given field or locus.


### How it might work:

```
Entity> query whois network
Network> EntityName1, EntityName2, EntityName3, etc
```
