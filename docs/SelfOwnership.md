# The Self & Selflessness

Insofar as it is recognized as a "convenience" that entities & things be described as having the [property `.self`](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/SelfState.md) it is also recognized that where "self" is recognized as a "valid" concept, an entity should be considered to have "[self-ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership)" over its "self" as "property."

> "each person enjoys, over himself and his powers, full and exclusive rights of control and use, and therefore owes no service or product to anyone else that he has not contracted to supply."

Alternatively, where "self" is not recognized as a "valid" concept, an entity shall still be considered to have "self-ownership" over "self" for the sake of "ease of use" amongst users with varied beliefs or experiential understandings of [selfhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namarupa).

> "In keeping with the doctrine of anātman/anatta, "the absence of an (enduring, essential) self", nāma and rūpa are held to be constantly in a state of flux, with only the continuity of experience (itself a product of dependent origination) providing an experience of any sort of conventional 'self'."
