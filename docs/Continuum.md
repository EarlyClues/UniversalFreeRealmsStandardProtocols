### If we are "many entities," how can we also be "one entity?"**

Each entity, while a `thing in itself`, is also a part of `Everything`. As such, when one speaks of `Everything` one speaks also of "all the entities" that make up `everything` and their "interrelations."

We can call this matrix of entities and their mutual relationships **The Continuum**.

It can be said, then, that all entities are effectively "embedded" in the `Continuum`, in that all entities are embedded within larger groupings of entities engaged in various relationships, exchanges, structures and assignments.

**Through the Continuum, each singular being is also able to be "many."**

It is from this under-lying interrelatedness of "things" that EntityNET can be built using the [Principles of Interaction](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/DiscoverabilityMutualityArbitration.md) as expressible in `Local Realms`.

### What is meant by "commonality of experience?"

In that all entities can be considered to be a part of a `Continuum` that connects to all entities directly through the `Everything` function of the `Universal API`, it can be said that all entities have certain things in "common:" **Their existence as "things," their access to the `Thingness Functions`, their options regarding `self`, their relatedness to other "things, their common governing rulesets and principles of interaction.**

While entity form, capacity and myriad other factors may be 'different,' we always all have at least "those things" in common.
