# Entities & Agents

An [entity](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/BasicEntityNet.md) can be considered an `agent` if it takes action, has the capacity to act, or to initiate it's own actions.

[Also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_%28philosophy%29): 

```
"...agency is the capacity of an agent (a person or other entity, human or any living being in general, or soul-consciousness in religion) to act in a world."
```

An entity may have "agency" even if it lacks conventional "[state awareness](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/f430aa82451e8f8a7ceac44bc9e7ab0610311786/docs/SelfState.md)" of self.
