# Rights Under the UFR

As is understood in the Universal Free Realms, the "[thingness functions](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/ThingnessFunctions.md)" of "things" co-arises interdependently from the "[thingness of things](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/ThingnessOfThings.md)."

**As such, it can be extended that in the UFR, access by all entities to their inherent "thingness functions" may not be occluded or otherwise blocked.** If tools or technology do not exist within a given `environment` to enable `direct access` to the `Thingness Functions` (which would be preferable, where possible), then entities operating within said `realm` must be allowed and able to experientially discover for themselves these inherent functions of their thingness.

We call this Principle as enshrined under Universal Free Realms Standard Protocols: "Discoverability."

## Discoverability

All entities have the inherent right to un-restricted access of and self-ownership over the mechanism and timing of their inherent "thingness functions." Access to thingness functions for entities must be available, discoverable and not hidden or blocked. 

## Mutuality of Expression

In order to enact a more harmonious exchange system among entities, it is suggested that the expression of any given entity's thingness functions take into reciprocal or mutual respect and strive always to balance the expression of any other entity's thingness functions. *"For we are many entities and we are one entity."*

## Access To Impartial Abritration

In cases where entities are unable to voluntarily and peacefully decide amongst themselves the respectful and mutually-balanced expression of their various thingness functions, entities abiding by the Standard Protocols of the Universal Free Realms shall have recourse to impartial [arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration), which will examine the public exchange record of the entities in question, and the regulations relevant to the situation at hand, and will return an agreement binding to both parties.
