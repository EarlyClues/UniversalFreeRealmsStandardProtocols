# Everything Incorporated & Its Sublicenses

Whereas `Everything` is composed of [all entities](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/1c16d6d489166cc32fb77af0ea6c2fc0dc74de11/docs/Continuum.md), and under UFR law, all entities are entitled to [Self-Ownership](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/SelfOwnership.md), it stands to reason that `Everything` as an entity also has ownership of `itself`.

That is, it could be considered that through the ownership of its `self`, `Everything` could also be considered the owner of the various entities of which it is composed - though the various entities themselves still are entitled to self-ownership.

Entities own themselves, but they are **also** owned by `Everything`, or "Everything Incorporated" - a name we give to `Everything` in its role as owner. 

While the entities which compose `Everything` own themselves, there is so far no other inherent exclusive "ownership" property included in UFR regulations. Insofaras entities may conventionally be able to said to "own" other entities, UFR principles replace this definintion with a "mutuality," "reciprocity," "association," "assignment" or "co-belonging."

And in so far as entities are able to exercise such alternative "ownership" with other entities, they are only able to do so as part of an EULA (End-User License Agreement) from `Everything Incorporated` which grants them access to assignment/reciprocity privileges in compliance with and identical to The Standard Protocols of the Universal Free Realms.
