# "Things" have [thingness](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/ThingnessOfThings.md).

**"Thingness" can be thought of as the *quality of the thing itself*, or its nature, properties and characteristics as an "entity."**

*An entity, then - as a thing - has its "thingness."*

* The "thingness" of things, in turn, has its own "thingness" - that is, the thingness of not the "thing itself" but of the "thingness-itself." 
* Though a "thing itself," the "thingness-itself" as a "thing" is also linked to the "thing" of which it is a component, and through which the "thingess" is likewise expressed.

**The "Thingness" of the "Thingness-Itself" may be usefully considered as a range of functions, capacities or capabilities of the "Thingness."**

## The Thingness Functions are:

* Assumption of thingness
* Thingness-itself (also: identity)
* Relationality of thingnesses (to other "things)
* Maintenance of thingness
* Transformation/modulation of thingness
* Reproduction of thingness
* Dissolution of thingness
* Thinglessness

*Note:* Insofar as "thinglessness" can be attributed as a function to the "thingness" of "things", we call to mind the inclusion of "nothing" within "everything", as well its ultimate externality.

**It is from the "Thingness Functions" that we are able to derive the principles outlined in the draft proposal of the [Universal Declaration of Entity Rights](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/Declaration_Of_Entity_Rights.md)**
