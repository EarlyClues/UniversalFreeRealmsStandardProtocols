#The Personal API calls *The Meaning Function* from the Universal API, and Vice-Versa.
*The "[Thingness](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/ThingnessOfThings.md)" of an entity exists in a potential state until a Meaning Function is called.*
*Meaning functions describe the relationship between Things. The Meaning Function is a single process function which produces foundational Wexes (connection algorithms) between [Thingness Functions](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/ThingnessFunctions.md).*

Example:

* Entity.Ape sees Entity.Banana, calls Meaning_Function from Universal API to produce a foundational Wex between Relationality of Entity.Banana and Maintenance of Entity.Ape. Wex in Entity.Ape.PUBLIC produces "EAT" function.

**"Everything" and "Nothing" are the only Things that have inherent Meaning Functions.** All other Things must call Meaning Functions from the Universal API.
