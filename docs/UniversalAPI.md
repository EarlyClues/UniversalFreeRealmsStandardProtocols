# What is the "Universal API?"

The Universal API is a public universal application programming interface for entity-level "Reality as a Service" (RaaS) interactions. It puts the tools for manipulating reality directly within each entity's domain of actionable control.

## What makes it "universal?"

The Universal API is open and available to all entities in all realities. Even if an entity's current reality "doesn't support" or actively blocks the Universal API, the Universal API still supports that entity.
