# Understanding EntityNet Basics

An "entity" is like a "point" in geometry...

Except that each entity-point has a "point of view" and can be understood from a "first person" perspective. (It may take a "self" or an "I" or can/should be treated as though it has.)

**Entities, like points, derive certain meanings or utility according to their arrangement in relation to other entities.**

*Entities may be arranged in fields or spaces:*

Their arrangement may be chaotic, or more "coherent" as a repeating pattern:

**Entities can also be linked together.** Links may be "pathways of exchange" or structures which connect two or more entities together.

When mulitple entities are linked together, we can consider this a "network" regardless of who, what, where, or when the entities "are."
