# Understanding EntityNet Basics

An "entity" is like a "point" in geometry...

Except that each entity-point has a "point of view" and can be understood from a "first person" perspective. (It may take a "self" or "selves" or an "I/we" and can/should be treated as though it has, whether or not it can be "proven" that it does.)

**Entities, like points, derive certain meanings or utility according to their arrangement in relation to other entities.**

*Entities may be arranged in fields or spaces:*

Their arrangement may be chaotic, or more "coherent" as a repeating pattern:

**Entities can also be linked together.** Links may be "pathways of exchange" or structures which connect two or more entities together.

When mulitple entities are linked together, we can consider this a "network" regardless of who, what, where, or when the entities "are."

When entities are linked together in a network, that group of linked entities can itself be considered an "entity" (as in holons)

Depending on nature of entities, their arrangement in a field, and the nature and arrangement of their links, the same entity-networks may take on different characteristics & capacities.
