# The Thingness of "Things"

**An entity is a thing; it is "something."**
* An entity is not "nothing," unless it is "nothing itself," which is itself also an entity.
* An entity is not "everything," unless it is "everything itself," which is itself an entity.

**Therefore: an entity may be something, nothing or everything.**
* Though, generally "nothing" and "everything" are reserved designations.

**But for practicality, an entity is "a thing itself," and this same definition applies for each entity.**
* Even "nothing" and "everything" are "things themselves."

**Each entity has its "thingness," its nature, properties and characteristics.**
* An entity has its "thingness" **within** the "thing" that is "everything itself."
* "Everything itself" has as its nature, properties and characteristics **all of the "things"** - including "nothing itself."
* An entity **doesn't have** its "thingness" within the "thing" that is "nothingness itself," but it does have it's "thingness" **in relation to** the "thing" that is "nothingness itself" as well as to all the other things.
* "Nothing itself" has only itself as its nature, properties and characteristics. Though other things **have relation to** it, it itself **has no relation** to these other "things."

**Each entity's "thingness" is relative to every other entities' "thingness", as well as to "everything itself" and "nothing itself."**

While it is true that "Everything" **includes** "nothing," it is therefore also true that "nothing" exists **outside of** "everything." 

We call this the "Outer Darkness." And unlike the "nothing" that exists within "everything," this "nothing" that is external to "everything" is not a "thing itself" and does not have its own nature, properties & characteristics.
