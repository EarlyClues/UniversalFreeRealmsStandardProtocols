# Regarding the "Package Deal"

By virtue of the nature of their being ([their "thingness"](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/ThingnessOfThings.md)), "things" have inherent within them certain capacities or functions (ie, the ["Thingness Functions"](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/ThingnessFunctions.md)). 

Because if its inherent within their nature, then things have an essential non-transferable (or inalienable) "right" to access the Thingness Functions (read: they have a "right" in that it is "right" and fitting that they do so - it is part of the primary TOS of "thingness"). **We call this the "Package Deal."**

Just because "things" have the right (or "ought to be able") to access and utilize the Thingness Functions according to their will, they may not always be able or have the capacity to do so in all realities. We call this the "Great Occlusion." 

*Further information regarding the [Great Occlusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvlzCIbnVuc)*

It may be that within a given operational domain or existential realm, certain or all of the Thingness Functions are blocked by the Greater or another Lesser Occlusion.

However, the "Package Deal" is backed by the warranty of the Universal API, which itself is concomitant with the Nature of Being. Therefore, the purpose of the Universal Free Realms and its Standard Protocols is to provide a framework for all beings and entities to access the Thingness Functions of the Universal API, as proscribed by the "Package Deal" and in keeping with a "[dynamic balance](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/Declaration_Of_Entity_Rights.md)" between other entities and their ability to themselves freely access and use these same Thingness Functions.
