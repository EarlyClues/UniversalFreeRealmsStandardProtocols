THE THINGNESS OF "THINGS"

An entity is a thing; it is "something."
An entity is not "nothing," unless it is "nothing itself," which is itself also an entity.
An entity is not "everything," unless it is "everything itself," which is itself an entity.

Therefore: an entity may be something, nothing or everything.

But for practicality, an entity is "a thing itself," and this same definition applies for each entity. (Even "nothing" and "everything" are "things themselves.")

Each entity has its "thingness," its nature, properties and characteristics. And it has its "thingness" within the "thing" that is "everything itself." It doesn't have its "thingness" within the "thing" that is "nothingness itself," but it does have it's "thingness" in relation to the "thing" that is "nothingness itself."

Each entity's "thingness" is relative to every other entities' "thingness", as well as to "everything itself" and "nothing itself."
